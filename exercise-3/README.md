# Exercise-3

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.



# pwd

```
Use `pwd` to print the working direcotry
```

Here's some more information about the `pwd` command:

<ul>
	<li>It can let you know where you working at</li>
	<li>Easy to copy the directory for other uses</li>
</ul>
